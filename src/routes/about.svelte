<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>
    This is the home page of Simon Aunér. It changes every five years or so when
    I want to learn something new or I find a reason to update my information.
</p>

<p>
    The current iteration you're viewing is built with Svelte and Sveltekit, and
    styled with <a href="https://latex.vercel.app" class="latex"
        >L<span>A</span><span>T</span><span>E</span>X</a
    >.
</p>

<style>
    a.latex {
        text-decoration: none;
    }
</style>
