<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>
    This is the home page of Simon Aun√©r. It changes every five years or so when
    I want to learn something new or I find a reason to update my information.

<p>
    The current iteration you're viewing is built with Svelte and Sveltekit.
    It's deployed to a Digital Ocean droplet.
